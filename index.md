# Shared Rules Index

This file routes the agent to the minimum relevant shared rules for the current repository and task.

## How To Use This Index

1. Identify the repository technology stack from the files in the workspace.
2. Identify the current task type, such as implementation, UI work, testing, documentation, or review.
3. Load only the rule files directly relevant to that stack and task.
4. Do not read unrelated rule files just because they exist in this directory.

## Rule Files

| File | Review When |
| --- | --- |
| [global_rules.md](global_rules.md) | Always review first for general coding expectations that apply across repositories. |
| [csharp_rules.md](csharp_rules.md) | Review when the repository uses C#, `.sln`, `.csproj`, or C# source files. |
| [wpf_rules.md](wpf_rules.md) | Review when the task touches WPF, XAML, desktop UI, bindings, view models, or Windows presentation concerns. |
| [cplusplus_rules.md](cplusplus_rules.md) | Review when the repository uses C++, especially Unreal Engine style and tooling. |
| [qt_rules.md](qt_rules.md) | Review when the repository uses Qt, CMake-based Qt apps, or Qt widgets/QML concerns. |
| [README.md](README.md) | Review only if you need background on how this shared rules directory is organized. |
| [.cursorrules](.cursorrules) | Review only if compatibility with the existing Cursor/Windsurf rule format is needed. |

## Selection Rules

- Always load [global_rules.md](global_rules.md).
- Load [csharp_rules.md](csharp_rules.md) when the repo contains `.sln`, `.csproj`, or `.cs` files.
- Load [wpf_rules.md](wpf_rules.md) only when WPF or XAML work is in scope.
- Load [cplusplus_rules.md](cplusplus_rules.md) when the repo contains `.uproject`, Unreal-style source layout, or C++ implementation files.
- Load [qt_rules.md](qt_rules.md) when the repo contains Qt project files, CMake Qt configuration, or Qt-specific source.
- Load multiple files when the stack requires it, but only if each file is directly relevant.

## Conflict Resolution

- Repository-local instructions override shared rules.
- Task-specific instructions override general rules.
- When two shared rules overlap, prefer the more specific technology rule for implementation details and retain the general rule for cross-cutting standards.

## Example Decisions

- New WPF app in a C# repo: review `global_rules.md`, `csharp_rules.md`, and `wpf_rules.md`.
- Unreal Engine feature work: review `global_rules.md` and `cplusplus_rules.md`.
- Documentation-only change in a C# repo: review `global_rules.md` and skip language-specific rules unless code is also being edited.
